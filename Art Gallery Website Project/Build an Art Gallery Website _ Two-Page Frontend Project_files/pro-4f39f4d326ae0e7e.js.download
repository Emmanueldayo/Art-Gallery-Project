If you'd like to receive feedback from the community, please be sure to post a question when you submit your solution. The more specific you can be, the better. Being clear with your questions means you're much more likely to receive valuable feedback from others.","Do you offer discounts?":"We don't offer any discounts on the Pro subscription beyond the regional discounts that we automatically apply.

We also have a large community of developers, so it's a great way to meet other devs!","Is it free?":"The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that are premium and require a [Pro subscription](/pro) to access. It will say on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to tell the difference.","Is there an official solution I can take a look at?":"We don't provide \"official\" solutions for the challenges. This is because there is no single perfect way to complete a challenge. Instead, you're encouraged to review other people's code in the community. You can learn so much by seeing how other people have approached the same challenges and giving them feedback.","Is there any way to sign-up other than GitHub?":"It's just GitHub at the moment. We only take the most basic information from your GitHub profile like email, username, profile picture, etc., and don't access your repositories.

To request a refund, email [hi@frontendmentor.io](mailto:hi@frontendmentor.io) within 14-days of starting your subscription.","Why are there credits limits on the monthly subscription?":"Due to the downloadable nature of our Pro assets (design files, premium challenges), we need credit limits for monthly subscribers. Otherwise, someone could subscribe for a month, download everything, and immediately cancel. So we need the limits in place so we can function as a business. The limits we've chosen allow a lot of practice on a month-to-month basis. You can download 5x design files for our free challenges, and you can take 2x premium challenges.","Why does my solution screenshot look different to the live version?":"We use a headless Chromium browser to take solution screenshots, so check your solution using Chrome to see how it looks. You might need to update your code to improve cross-browser consistency. If the screenshot still looks different, please email us at [hi@frontendmentor.io](mailto:hi@frontendmentor.io), and we'll look into it.","What happens when my subscription expires?":"When your subscription expires, all private solutions are made public. You go back to having five screenshot credits per month. If you have a yearly subscription, your design and premium credits reset to zero. If you have a monthly subscription, unused credits remain on your account until you use them.","What is the difference between the desktop-design, mobile-design, and desktop-preview images in my starter code?":"The desktop-design and mobile-design images show you how the layout should look at large and small screen sizes. The desktop design is 1440px wide, and the mobile design is 375px. However, try building projects to look good on all screen sizes. The desktop-preview image is a preview image used in the README file. You don’t need to reference this while building the project."},n=o(8043);n.Z.FAQ.questions=a;var r=n.Z},32253:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:function(){return i}});var s=o(85893),a=o(41664),n=o.n(a);let r=(0,o(99036).tv)({base:["bg-blue-500","font-bold","px-1","rounded-sm","text-white","tracking-widest","uppercase"]});function i(e){let{className:t,isLink:o,title:a}=e,i=(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:r({class:t}),title:a,children:"Pro"});return o?(0,s.jsx)(n(),{href:"/pro",children:i}):i}},90903:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:function(){return r}});var s=o(85893),a=o(67294);let n=(0,o(99036).tv)({base:["bg-white","border","border-neutral-200","rounded-lg"]}),r=({children:e,className:t,heading:o,isOpen:r})=>{let[i,l]=(0,a.useState)(r);return(0,s.jsxs)("details",{className:n({class:t}),open:i,children:[(0,s.jsx)("summary",{className:"cursor-pointer list-none [&::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden",onClick:e=>{e.preventDefault(),l(!i)},children:(0,a.cloneElement)(o,{isOpen:i})}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"border-t border-neutral-200",children:e})]})}},64917:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:function(){return i}});var s=o(85893),a=o(99036),n=o(30003);let r=(0,a.tv)({slots:{wrapper:["bg-no-repeat","flex","flex-col","gap-6","items-center","px-6","py-8","text-center","text-lg","rounded-lg","[background-image:theme(backgroundImage.patternSquiggle),theme(backgroundImage.patternBracket),theme(backgroundImage.patternDots)]","[background-position:top_10%_left_-10%,top_-6rem_right_15%,bottom_-0.5rem_right_-0.5rem]","tablet:[background-position:top_50%_left_-10%,top_-5rem_right_10%,bottom_-0.5rem_right_-5px]","desktop:[background-position:top_50%_left_0,_top_-4rem_right_15%,bottom_-0.5rem_right_-5px]"],heading:["max-w-[theme(containerWidth.sm)]"]},variants:{theme:{dark:{wrapper:["bg-blue-500","text-white"],heading:["text-white"]},light:{wrapper:["bg-gray-100","text-neutral-500"],heading:["text-neutral-900"]}}}}),i=({className:e,children:t,heading:o,theme:a})=>{let{wrapper:i,heading:l}=r({theme:a});return(0,s.jsxs)("section",{className:i({class:e}),children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.H,{className:l(),level:"3",tagName:"h2",children:o}),t]})}},8043:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:function(){return u}});var s=o(85893),a=o(99036),n=o(90903),r=o(85860),i=o(19537);let l=({children:e,isOpen:t})=>(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex gap-4 items-center justify-between px-5 py-4",children:[(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"font-secondary font-semibold",children:e}),(0,s.jsx)(r.Z,{className:"text-lg",name:t?"minus":"plus",style:"solid"})]}),c=({question:e})=>(0,s.jsx)("li",{children:(0,s.jsx)(n.Z,{heading:(0,s.jsx)(l,{children:e}),children:(0,s.jsx)(i.Z,{className:"px-5 py-4 text-neutral-500",children:c.questions[e]})})});c.questions={};var d=o(30003);let h=(0,a.tv)({base:["flex","flex-col","gap-5","w-full"]}),u=({children:e,className:t,heading:o,headingTag:a="h2"})=>(0,s.jsxs)(o?"section":"div",{className:h({class:t}),children:[o&&(0,s.jsx)(d.H,{className:"text-center",level:"2",tagName:a,children:o}),(0,s.jsx)("ul",{className:"flex flex-col gap-3",children:e})]});u.FAQ=c},2429:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:function(){return r}});var s=o(85893),a=o(22160),n=o(85860);let r=({className:e,children:t})=>(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:e,children:[(0,s.jsx)("h2",{className:"sr-only",children:"Testimonials"}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"container-sm flex flex-col gap-5 desktop:container-xl desktop:flex-row",children:t})]});r.Card=({avatar:e,children:t,name:o,title:r})=>(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"basis-0 bg-neutralWhite border border-neutralLightGrey flex flex-col flex-grow flex-shrink gap-6 items-center rounded-2xl p-5 shadow",children:[(0,s.jsxs)("p",{className:"tablet:text-lg desktop:my-auto",children:['"',t,'"']}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-wrap gap-4 items-center justify-between w-full",children:[(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex gap-3 items-center",children:[(0,s.jsx)(a.Z,{image:e}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col gap-1",children:[(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"font-bold text-blue-500",children:o}),(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"text-neutral-500 text-sm",children:r})]})]}),(0,s.jsx)(n.Z,{className:"text-indigo-100 text-[3.5rem]",name:"quote-right",style:"solid"})]})]})}},function(e){e.O(0,[1414,9537,7713,3260,2888,9774,179],function(){return e(e.s=5552)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
